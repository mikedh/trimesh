    also attenuates in a physically correct manner as distance increases from
    the light's position (i.e. brightness goes like the inverse square of the
    distance). Spot light intensity refers to the brightness inside the
    `innerConeAngle` (and at the location of the light) and is defined in
    candela, which is lumens per square radian (lm/sr). A spot light's position
