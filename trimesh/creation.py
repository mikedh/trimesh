    Revolve a 2D line string around the 2D Y axis, with a result with
    the 2D Y axis pointing along the 3D Z axis.

    This function is intended to handle the complexity of indexing
    and is intended to be used to create all radially symmetric primitives,
    eventually including cylinders, annular cylinders, capsules, cones,
    and UV spheres.

    Note that if your linestring is closed, it needs to be counterclockwise
    if you would like face winding and normals facing outwards.

    Parameters
    -------------
    linestring : (n, 2) float
      Lines in 2D which will be revolved
    angle
      Angle in radians to revolve curve by or if not
      passed will be a full revolution (`angle = 2*pi`)
    cap
      If not a full revolution (`0.0 < angle < 2 * pi`)
